<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Empowering everyday people to explore and address their relationship with alcohol and other drugs in a compassionate, judgement‑free space. By blending lived experience, professional counselling, and flexible, affordable group sessions, participants will discover their own answers and understand how their relationships with their family, work, and life have been impacted—without putting their lives on hold.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Is This Program for You?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you ever wonder if alcohol or other drugs are negatively impacting your life?</li>
<li>Have loved ones expressed concern about your drinking or drug use?</li>
<li>Do you ever wonder “What is happening to me?”?</li>
<li>Are you afraid or ashamed to talk to others about how you truly feel?</li>
<li>Are you curious to see how “going dry/clean” could feel—without committing to a residential rehab?</li>
<li>Are you able to meet in person in our Bayside location Mon/Wed/Fri 4‑7 pm for 4 weeks?</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these resonate, <strong>Revise Your Life</strong> can help you discover answers in a safe, supportive space.</p>
